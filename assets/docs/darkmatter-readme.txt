DarkMatter, Win x86_64
--------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:
-------------
DarkMatter can automatically detect your game installation path, subject to registry settings. If it cannot detect your paths, there are registry files to correct this (modify the files in a text editor to your correct paths.)

DarkMatter can also detect an installation path if run from it - it will search for both the original game executable in current folder and main pak file and appropriate subfolder.
