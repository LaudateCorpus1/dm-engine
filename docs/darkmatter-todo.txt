DarkMatter

Based on Quake3e - 16 Jan 2021 release
--------------------------------------------

TODO:
-----
- Push changes from Quake3e at next major release
- TrueType font from Spearmint
- Complete Q2 BSP support
- Q1 BSP collision model
- Q1 BSP to renderer
- Q1 BSP texture extraction from BSP
- Q1 WAD loading
- PAK file loading
- PAK checksums tests for Q1/Q2, do not download rules for official paks
- MD2 model support
- MDL model support
- WAL image loading
- Negative values for fs_%GAME%_load to enable loading only in localhost, server info to add serverlist filter for servers with certain game bases
- Asset base rules for QL: check for assets in Q3 first to avoid shader conflicts
- Asset base flags for map loading, ie: map -q2 q2dm1 to search only QUAKE II path for the map
- Asset base indicators for auto-complete map lists
- File system check for loading DarkMatter from a game dir to override the appropriate fs_%GAME%_path (eg: check for original quake3.exe and baseq3/pak0.pk3)

Low-priority/future TODO:
-------------------------
- Merge duplicate rendering code shared by r1, rvk to rcommon
- Language file support
- GeoIP
