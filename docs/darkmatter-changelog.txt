DarkMatter

Based on Quake3e - 16 Jan 2021 release
--------------------------------------------

CHANGELOG:
----------
+ Windows: Automatic game installation path detection for CD, Steam and GOG installations of QUAKE, QUAKE II, QUAKE III: ARENA and QUAKE LIVE.
	DarkMatter can be installed anywhere.
	Paths are stored in (and can be overridden in command line) fs_%GAME%_path where %GAME% is q, q2, q3 or ql for the appropriate game.
+ Initial multi-game asset base support, enable on command line via +set "fs_%GAME%_load [1|2|3]" where %GAME% is q, q2, q3 or ql for the appropriate game.
	 The filesystem will search in order of CD, Steam then GOG. Setting the cvar value to 2 or 3 will skip to Steam or GOG respectively. This does not apply to QUAKE LIVE which has only a Steam path.
+ On filesystem init, the engine will now try to check if current directory contains one or more games. This is done by checking the existence of both the original game executable and main pak file. It will then override the appropriate fs_%GAME%_path if loading is eneabled for that game. Cvar fs_gameDetect holds a bitmask of detected game titles.
+ QUAKE LIVE support:
	* BSP loading [IBSP 47]
	* Ad banners converted to func_statics
	* noVLCollapse shader stage
	* snowsteps and woodsteps surface parms
	+ OGG Vorbis codec
+ Full aspect ratio correction via r_arc_* cvars
+ Entity override dumping/loading to modify map entities:
	sv_ent_dump [0|1]: Enabling saving .ent entity files on level loads and map_restart.
	sv_ent_dump_path: Path within maps/ directory where .ent entity files are to be saved to.
	sv_ent_load [0|1]: Enabling loading .ent entity files to override map entities.
	sv_ent_load_path: Path within maps/ directory where .ent entity files are to be loaded from.
+ Alias support straight from QUAKE II: creates custom commands (or even custom button commands using +/-).
	Example:
		alias atest "say This is an alias"
		bind A atest
	Use unAlias to move a specific alias or unAliasAll to remove all aliases.
+ Neatened up cvar system, consistent naming conventions applied across most cvars and commands.
+ Detailed cvar descriptions available in console for almost all engine-based cvars.
+ cvarAdd, cvarMulti commands to modify cvar values
+ r_screenshotNameFormat [string]: Set naming convention for screenshots. Valid hashtag tokens to use:
	[#02/#04]y: year, [#02/#]m = month, [#02/#]d = day, [#02/#]h = hour, [#02/#]n = minute, [#02/#]s = second, #l = mapname, #g = gametype
	Example: r_screenshotNameFormat "#l-#g" //This will name screenshots as current map name + gametype + index, such as screenshots/pro-q3dm6-3.tga, screenshots/pro-q3dm6-3-0002.tga, etc.
+ r_defaultImageStyle [0|1|2]: Default image style for missing or invalid shaders/textures:
		0: QUAKE III grey with white outlines
		1: QUAKE checkerboard
		2: QUAKE II small red and black tiles
+ r_defaultImageSize <value>: Set image size for default images.
+ r_drawSkyFloor [0|1]: Draw the bottom plane of scrolling sky boxes.
+ r_clearColor [0|1]: Set color to clear buffer to in hex RGB format. Requires \r_clear 1.
+ r_teleporterFlash [0|1|2]: Screen flash effect when teleporting:
		0: Disabled
		1: Black
		2: White
+ Configuration files are now loaded from cfg/ subdirectory or cfg-sv/ when dedicated.
+ Base configuration file is now config.cfg.
+ Windows home path for user files now set to %APPDATA%/DarkMatter.
+ cl_cinematics_arc [0|1]: Show cinematics at intended aspect ratio.
+ r_dlightDesaturate <0.0..1.0>: Colour desaturation for dynamic lights. Set to 0 to revert to original colour values.
+ r_fogGreyScale <0.0..1.0>: Desaturates fog volumes, works independently from r_greyScale.
+ All listing commands renamed to "list%TYPE%", such as cvarList now named as listCvars.
+ cl_allowConsoleChat [0|1]: Console command capture behaviour. Valid options:
	0: Console always assumes input as commands.
	1: Console assumes chat command when cvars or commands are not found.
+ listDefShaders command lists all defaulted (missing/invalid) shaders
